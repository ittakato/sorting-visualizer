# Sorting Visualizer

This is a sorting visualizer app built using React. It visualizes four classic sorting algorithms: bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. I built this app with inspiration from [Clement Mihailescu's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc). I built this app because I thought it would be a great way to improve both my React skills and my algorithm skills.

This app is deployed on GitHub Pages: https://ittakato.github.io/sorting-visualizer/.
